# Better graphs

Definition of success:
Make it look pretty

Glance at the production version with the our forked version

Steps to glory:

## first step

- 2 columns => one d3, 2nd apex (manual overwrite by instance id)
- commit to database for shared source of truth
- TDD transformer (single dataset) for all three (pie, line, trends)
- find a way to serve staging with the forked version

## second step

- Transform layout (width & height)
- Extend transformer (TDD) for the needed metabase parameters (2-3 parameters)

=> POC ready!
